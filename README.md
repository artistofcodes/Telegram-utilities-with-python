## 1. Telethon File Downloader (Private Chat Flow)  
A Telethon script that runs as a user client and interacts with you via **private messages** to download media from any chat.

**Features:**  
- Works through private chat commands (`/start`)  
- Specify target chat (username or ID)  
- Supports date range filtering (`YYYY-MM-DD`)  
- File type filters (`photo`, `video`, `document`, `audio`, `voice`, `all`)  
- Optional sender username filter  
- Creates a ZIP of downloaded files and sends it back to you  
- Fully interactive chat flow  

**Setup:**  
1. Create a Telegram app at [https://my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org)  
2. Note your `api_id` and `api_hash`  
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install telethon
   ```
   If VS Code shows  
   `Import "telethon.errors" could not be resolved`,  
   install the library and select the right Python interpreter (`Ctrl + Shift + P â†’ Python: Select Interpreter`).  
4. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python file_downloader.py
   ```
5. Sign in once with your phone number â€” a `.session` file will be created automatically.

**Limitations:**  
- Works only for user accounts (not bots)  
- Requires you to be a member of the target chat  
- Avoid downloading private content without consent
